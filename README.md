Rivers transport sediment particles. Individual particles can exhibit transport behavior that differs significantly when compared to other particles. py_SBeLT, which stands for *Stochastic Bed Load Transport*, provides a simple Python framework to numerically examine how individual particle motions in rivers combine to produce rates of transport that can be measured at one of a number of downstream points. The model can be used for basic research, and the model's relatively straightforward set-up makes it an effective and efficient teaching tool to help students build intuition about river transport of sediment particles.

## Installation

### Quick Installation

```bash
pip install sbelt
```

### Installation from Source

Clone the `py_SBeLT` GitHub repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/szwiep/py_SBeLT.git
```

Then set your working directory to `py_SBeLT/` and build the project

```bash
 cd py_SBeLT/
 python setup.py build_ext --inplace
 pip install -e .
```

### Testing your installation

If you've installed from source, you can test the installation by setting your working directory to `py_SBeLT/` 
and running the following

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s src/tests --buffer
```

## Getting Started

Users can work through the Jupyter Notebooks provided to gain a better understanding of py_SBeLT's basic usage, potential, and data storage methods. Either launch the binder instance ([![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/szwiep/py_SBeLT/master?labpath=docs%2Fnotebooks%2F)), clone the repository, or download the notebooks directly to get started.

If notebook's aren't your thing, simply run:

```bash
sbelt-run
```

or

```bash
from sbelt import sbelt_runner
sbelt_runner.run()
```

## Documentation

Documentation, including Jupyter Notebooks, API documentation, [default parameters](https://github.com/szwiep/py_SBeLT/blob/master/docs/DEFAULT_PARAMS.md), and [model nomenclature](https://github.com/szwiep/py_SBeLT/blob/master/docs/NOMENCLATURE.md), can be found in the repository's `docs/` directory. Additional information regarding the theoritical motivation of the model can be found in the [`paper/paper.md`](https://github.com/szwiep/py_SBeLT/blob/master/paper/paper.md) and [`THEORY.md`](https://github.com/szwiep/py_SBeLT/blob/master/THEORY.md) files.

Two Jupyter Notebooks describe [basic usage](https://github.com/szwiep/py_SBeLT/blob/master/docs/notebooks/basic_usage_sbelt.ipynb) and [the structure of the output hdf5 format file](data_storage_sbelt.ipynb).

The API documentation is in HTML format. These files can either be downloaded and viewed directly in your browser or can be viewed using the [GitHub HTML preview project](https://htmlpreview.github.io/).
